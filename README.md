## Virtual Shell
A program to run an Unix shell command inside an virtual environment (assuming the disk image used is Linux).
### How It [Would] Work(s)
virtsh takes the iamge and emulates it using QEMU. However, because of bootloaders showing up, it takes the disk's filesystem and runs the command as if it had booted. 
#### I don't have any experience with emulation
Yeah...
